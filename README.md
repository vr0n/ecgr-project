# ECGR Floating Point Processor Project
### by Ryan, Rachel, and Zac

### TO-DO
- [ ] Integrate working functions into one file
- [ ] Start on ISA

### Checkpoint 0
#### Converting from real decimal (base 10) to 32 bit, floating point binary (base 2)
- For Checkpoint 0, bin-to-dec.cpp does the conversion from binary to dec, and main.cpp does decimal to binary
- main.cpp will house both functions by next Checkpoint, which is why it offers that in the menu
