# ECGR Floating Point Processor Project
### by Ryan, Rachel, and Zac

### TO-DO
- [x] Integrate working functions into one file
- [ ] Start on ISA

### Milestone 0
#### Converting from real decimal (base 10) to 32 bit, floating point binary (base 2)
- For Checkpoint 0, bestController.cpp does both conversion.
- Currently, bestController.cpp takes manual entries for example purposes. This will, of course be changed when necessary to take actual input.

### Milestone 1
#### Creating the instruction functions and documenting the ISA
